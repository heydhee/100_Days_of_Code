# 100 Days of Code
## Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu
Hey all this is Dhee learning python. Though I tried to learn various times before I never built anything or should I say I never learnt as much to build anything.<br><br>
Though I had python as a subject in my first semester all I could remember is that tuple is immutable but lists are mutable.<br><br>
