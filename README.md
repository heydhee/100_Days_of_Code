# 100 Days of Code
## Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu
Hey all!! this is Dhee learning python. Though I tried to learn various times before I never built anything <br> or should I say I never learnt as much to build anything.<br><br>
Though I had python as a subject in my first semester all I could remember is that tuple is immutable but lists are mutable.<br><br>
I thought I could teach myself to code but ended up going down the tutorial hell.<br><br>
I'm not confident with my skills after doing W3schools I felt like wanting more.<br<br>
Watching youtube videos meant going down the tutorial hell and they feel unproductive.<br>
