# 100 Days of Code

Hey all!! this is Dhee learning python. Though I tried to learn various times before I never built anything <br> or should I say I never learnt as much to build anything.<br><br>

Though I had python as a subject in my first semester all I could remember is that tuple is immutable but lists are mutable.<br><br>
I thought I could teach myself to code but ended up going down the tutorial hell.<br><br>
I'm not confident with my skills after doing W3schools I felt like wanting more.<br><br>
Watching youtube videos meant going down the tutorial hell and they feel unproductive and this cycle has been around for a year:( .<br><br>

When I surfed around the web I got to know about 100 days of code being popular so I tried to give it a go.<br>
I am also taking a course along with the challenge to not get lost while learning.<br><br>
The following are the three reasons that prompted me to take up the course(as well as the challenge)
* I have a deadline<br> - I have a set of tasks i.e. 100 challenges for 100 days <br>that I must complete before the 100 day ends
* I have a curriculum<br> - I wouldn't get lost in the tutorial hell just watching about the same beginner tutorial again and again
* Projects and Hands on Programming<br> - The course is filled with interactive exercises and projects and I will not end up doing nothing.<br><br><br>
In this repo, I decided to document my journey through the 100 days!!!
